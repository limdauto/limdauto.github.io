Hallo, in real life, I am one of the following, not necessarily in that order:

- Full-stack Software Developer at [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/home/)
- Master student in Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](www.omscs.gatech.edu)
- Mental sport competitor. I competed in the World Memory Championship in 2013, although rather unsuccessfully. I will make a comeback in a near future.
- Maths & FP lover. I was pursuing Mathematics in college but burnt-out and took a break, which unfortunately extended into a few years. Recently, I have rediscovered my love for the discipline through functional programming and I intend to commit fully this time.

Most importantly, though, I think I'm a full-time ed-tech junkie. I love learning and I love working on tools to help people learn better.
