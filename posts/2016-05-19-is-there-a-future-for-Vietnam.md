I've just read [this note from a friend of a friend](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ngoc-hien-bui/8-ti%E1%BA%BFng-c%E1%BA%A7m-gi%E1%BB%AF-v%C3%A0-2-gi%E1%BB%9D-tranh-lu%E1%BA%ADn/10153739507964514).
And it makes me sick, physically sick. That's saying a lot since I have had 25 years of hardcore training in ignoring random posts
on the Internet about the oppressive state of the country. But this isn't just a random post. The guy who wrote it could
have been me -- a young, decent 20-something with a normal job and a good life ahead if we keep our head down and play by the rules.
Those god damn rules.

I love Vietnam. To borrow Ngo Bao Chau's words, I know I love Vietnam because I care about her well-being and that of her people.
Right now she is sick, her people hopeless. And I don't know what to do.

Does anyone know? Could someone please tell me?
