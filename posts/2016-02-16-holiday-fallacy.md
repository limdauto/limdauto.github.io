Even though the myth that [suicide rate is higher during holiday season has been debunked](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/no-suicides-dont-rise-during-the-holidays/419436/), it's no secret that holiday is about happiness and, to some extent, change: change of scenary from a supposedly stressful environment at work to the warm and sunny beach, change of habit from excessive coffee consuming to slow tea tasting, and change of mindset from bearing with it till Friday comes to savoring every moment of every relaxing day. That's why resolution lists make round on the Internet every single New Year's Eve to examplify the change spirit; holiday can change people too.

I disagree with all of that. Although some going away and recharing is necessary from time to time, the best superpower comes from the ability to live every day with perfect tranquility and mindfulness as if you are on holiday. And it's hard, isn't it? I think I am writing all of this to say that I'm already very tired of my holiday and can't wait to get back to work. Work I can cope with. It's life I'm struggling with.

But there is one silver lining from all this time off. I have gotten back in touch again with a few causes that used to be important to me. That said, I will try to get a volunteer job at a mental health center after I'm back in London. Can't wait.
