title: Halfway Review of Coursera Big Data Analytics Specialization
tags: coursera, big data

I always try my best to stay away from public rant because it is the least effective form of communication. But this one deserves it.

I have always LOVED Coursera. My very first MOOC experience was with the second iteration of Introduction to Functional Programming in Scala a few years back. What a treat! Taught by Martin Odersky himself and moderated by a tech lead at Typesafe, it was the pinnacle of online education: good content, vibrant community and very on-point guidance in the form of solid exercises as well as engaging forum discussions. Over the years, I have audited quite a few more courses offered by the company's partners, all with overwhelmingly positive experience. So this is not about Coursera; this is about their new [Big Data specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data).

I am genuinely interested in this specialization because of the Graph Analytics in Big Data course for which I am having immediate need. Given that this program is designed by the Super Computing center at UCSD and marketed as "hands-on, practical", I was justifiably having high expectations, especially for exciting real-world giant-scale data examples. Maybe I shouldn't have because it makes the disappointment a lot worse.

> I was strictly paying for the video content, which isn't a premise I bought. And even the videos themselves are terrible.
*tl;dr*

I have a deeply held belief that knowledge, as in facts, should be free and open.
That's why every year when Jimmy Wales sends me an email to donate to Wikipedia, I do it without hesitation.
For example, if I want to learn HDFS commands, I can just [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM),
and if I want to checkout a MapReduce tutorial as a total beginner, [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=map+reduce+tutorial).
The education I am willing and eager to pay for is more about guidance and mentorship,
the most basic form of which is just good exercises along the way to solidify learnt concepts.
Interestingly, in technical learning, good exercises are often enough for beginners.
Deep understanding can come with time and experiences.
Case in point, the best online learning experience I have ever had has 0 minute of video lecture.
[It's just a collection of pdf and html files but the exercise quality is off the chart](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/).

This specialization has terrible exercises so far.
They even managed to make [extremely good exercises freely available from the Internet](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/) worse by removing important comments in the code and adding in totally useless ones. I understand the need to satisfy people from different backgrounds, but you can solve it in a manner much more elegant than putting "if is a conditional statement in python" in a freaking Hadoop reducer code. For example, Udacity refers inexperienced learners to other supporting courses to catch up rather than dumbing things down, which greatly obfuscates important matter in the sea of insignificant junk. Instruction always seems to be written in haste with terrible formatting. Code is formatted as text and text is inside code block with zero coherent heading whatsoever. Did anyone proof-read that before it went live?

Quizzes are more confusing than helpful, sometimes debatable at best and downright wrong at worse. If you put "continuous" and "resilient distributed datasets" in a phrase together, you'd better be able to explain what you mean, because last time I check continuous and distributed are very close to being antonym. Worse, there is no staff available to explain or clarify these points, so sometimes it's very frustrating guess-work and not at all educational.

There is no sense of community, which is the single greatest element that could make or break distant learning, largely due to the absence of a course/specialization moderator. If you need a hint regarding how a great learning community looks like, go checkout the various slack channels of Udacious folks.

The worst part, though, is the video content itself. I can overlook badly produced videos because we are not in the film making business. I can overlook bad presenter, even if your speaking is incomprehensible, because we are not in the public speaking business. I can even overlook reading word-by-word off the slide and the fact that you are ignoring your unique delivery medium, because let's face it, we are used to it in traditional classroom. But being irresponsible about what you teach is simply unacceptable, especially because that's what you are charging for. When you record a tutorial and make a mistake, stop the tape to try understand what's going on. You can't simply brush it off and move on as if nobody will ever notice it. It shows how little respect you have for your students. And you can be sure that some disgruntled nerd will make a long rant on LinkedIn about it.

<p class="typl8-drop-cap">
In conclusion, I am staying till the end because I am halfway through and I still need to figure out that Graph Analytics stuff.
But I will need serious convincing if Coursera ever tries to sell me their specialization again.
It's exactly like buying a ridiculously overpriced, badly written book.
