title: I am a very slow learner, but that's alright

I have a long list of people I often stalk. Well, "stalk" may be too strong of
a word. "Secretly admire and semi-consciously envy" sounds better
(and perhaps less creppy). It's actually quite simple to be admitted to the list.
There is an online application form you need to fill in and a $50 application fee.
Or you just need to be a fast learner, because that's my biggest insecurity. I don't
have any problem whatsoever with appearance or money. I know my head is ridiculously
big compared to my body size, but many of my friends find the trait endearing, so I
use it as my online moniker. You see, **limdauto** means big headed Lim (literally)
in Vietnamese. I also turned down a job offer last year which promised a doubled raw
salary, before adjusting for the cost of living and tax difference, because
getting rich is not what I am after. I just want to enjoy life, and in my opinion,
the only way to enjoy life is to learn as much as one can about it. As
the brilliant physicist Edward Purcell has so eloquently put it:

<center>
> I have not yet lost a feeling of wonder, and of delight, that this delicate motion should reside in all the things around us, revealing itself only to him who looks for it. I remember, in the winter of our first experiments, just seven years ago, looking on snow with new eyes. There the snow lay around my doorstep â€” great heaps of protons quietly precessing in the earth's magnetic field. To see the world for a moment as something rich and strange is the private reward of many a discovery.

So through some twisted logic, my brain has forever synonymized life-fulfillment with the capacity to learn and discover.
Needless to say, I am jealous of people who learn fast and discovery quickly.
They always seem to ask the right questions, pick out the right details from endless
stream of information effortlessly, and distill knowledge methodically. You may think
I am describing the Big Foot of intellectual fantasyland, but they do present in my life.

I don't think I will ever be able to get over this insecurity, no matter how much I hate myself for it.
But I have also learned to come to term with it on most days.
Being slow shouldn't stop me from trying. Please just excuse me when I get a bit impatient
and say something stupid before fully understanding it. Old habit dies hard I suppose :)
