title: Next Stop: Interesting Monads
tags: haskell
---

During a hackathon yesterday at the company where I work,
I finished the implementation of [my own little scheme](https://github.com/limdauto/leme).
It's quite exciting because I have always meant to read SICP (duh!), so this time I will follow through to the end and
try to solve problems in the book using my Scheme implementation.

Regardless, it's time for my Haskell train to move along to the next station.
I suppose the next natural steps would be to try my hand on all of the interesting
abstractions in the language, and thankfully there is a [suggested list for Monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad#Interesting_monads).
Among all of them, I think I am most curious about 3 things:

- The Free Monad
- Extensible Effect, i.e. the Eff monad
- And of course, transformers.

So it's time to crack on. Mind the door please, mind the door.
