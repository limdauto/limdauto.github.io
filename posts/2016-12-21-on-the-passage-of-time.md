title: Fairy tales, Jin Yong, Dan Ariely, and the Passage of Time

I'm only 4 days into this holiday but it's already turning out to be quite enjoyable.

First, I've been trying to read fairy tales in German to ramp up my vocabulary before the trip to Berlin on Saturday.
Then thanks to the [Instant Gratification Monkey](waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html),
I found and ended up binge-watching a couple of Once Upon A Time seasons. No regret there, though, as I like it.
The series reminds me of all the wonderful stories I read when I was a kid,
which in retrospect all seem incredible as to how insightful they can be.
They transcend time, space and races, revealing what never changes about human's nature:
the lust for wealth and power, the longing for love and an acute awareness of our own mortality.
We often speak these days of our progress as a civilization and look to the sky as the next frontier,
but I have a feeling that the many generations of mankind living on Mars in the future will still
know not to ask a talking mirror for parenting advice. Terrible idea!

And then I briefly revisited [Jin Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong).
I used to think that it was such a shame my generation of Vietnamese grow up with a buffet of media and arts from other cultures,
ranging from Chinese literature and TVs, Western shows and movies, Japanese manga and anime,
Korean dramas and pop music, while having very little that we can authentically call our own.
But this stance of mine has changed over the years. Now I consider it a privilege.
When I feel lost navigating the modern life as I am now, I simply have way more options to fallback on
for some internal compass, among which are Jin Yong's novels. I worship some of the relationships he painted
and part of me still wish such beautiful, loyal love as the one in Xiao Ao Jiang Hu does happen to us mortals.
I know it's very similar to a 7 year old girl worshiping Prince Charming and Snow White. Please don't judge.

Dan Ariely has recently published a new book called [Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Payoff-Hidden-Logic-Shapes-Motivations/dp/1501120042/).
I have watched all of his TED talks and read Predictably Irrational, so I will probably not buy this one.
However, it's timely reminder of how badly I am handling my professional life at the moment.
Well, we can throw personal life at that too. In particular, the book mentions an experiment simulating the Sisyphic condition,
a term derives from the ancient Greek story about Sisyphus, who was condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill only to have it roll down again and again for eternity.
This condition of seemingly ripping away meaning in one's work, without a doubt, happens a lot in software development.
There is the classic requirement change that simply voids prior effort,
the evolution of an use case that requires a completely new system, regardless of how suitable an existing one was at its moment of birth,
the opinionated, and if not careful, contemptuous nature of software rewrite.
I understand that system evolves but the question isn't whether we should change. The question is how to introduce it.
I learned it the hard way when I first started out that coming in and simply throwing things away without discussion is the best way
to alieniate and demoralize even the best well-intentioned of teammate. Software development, after all, is still a team sports.
Maybe in 5 years one can hide in a bedroom and interact with a bunch of neural nets to churn out code, but not right now.
And that's the million-dollar question of the day, how do you create an environment that begets meaning, not terminates it.

Lastly, I want to mention today beautiful piece in the New Yorker, [The Secret Life of Time](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/the-secret-life-of-time).
It reminds me so much of the haunting feeling I had after reading Alan Lightman's [Einstein's Dream](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Einsteins-Dreams-Bloomsbury-Classic-Lightman/dp/0747518599),
so I will conclude with a Lightman's quote:

> In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second squirms and wriggles like a bluefish in a bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined. The second makes up its mind as it goes along.
Many are convinced that mechanical time does not exist. When they pass the giant clock on the Kramgasse they do not see it; nor do they hear its chimes while sending packages on Postgasse or strolling between flowers in the Rosengarten. They wear watches on their wrists, but only as ornaments or as courtesies to those who would give timepieces as gifts. They do not keep clocks in their houses. Instead, they listen to their heartbeats. they feel the rhythms of their moods and desires. Such people eat when they are hungry, go to their jobs at the millinery or the chemist’s whenever they wake from their sleep, make love all hours of the day. Such people laugh at the thought of mechanical time. They know that time moves in fits and starts. They know that time struggles forward with a weight on its back when they are rushing an injured child to the hospital or bearing the gaze of a neighbor wronged. And they know too that time darts across the field of vision when they are eating well with friends or receiving praise or lying in the arms of a secret lover.
Then there are those who think that their bodies don’t exist. They live by mechanical time. They rise at seven o’clock in the morning. They eat their lunch at noon and their supper at six. They arrive at their appointments on time, precisely by the clock. They make love between eight and ten at night. They work forty hours a week, read the Sunday paper on Sunday, play chess on Tuesday nights. When their stomach growls, they look at their watch to see if it is time to eat. When they begin to lose themselves in a concert, they look at the clock above the stage to see when it will be time to go home. They know that the body is not a thing of wild magic, but a collection of chemicals, tissues, and nerve impulses. Thoughts are no more than electrical surges in the brain. Sexual arousal is no more than a flow of chemicals to certain nerve endings. Sadness no more than a bit of acid transfixed in the cerebellum. In short, the body is a machine, subject to the same laws of electricity and mechanics as an electron or clock. As such, the body must be addressed in the language of physics. And if the body speaks, it is the speaking of only so many levers and forces. The body is a thing to be ordered, not obeyed.>
